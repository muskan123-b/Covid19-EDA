# About COVID-19
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. It took 67 days (∼7th march) to infect 1 lakh people from COVID-19, an additional 12 days (∼19th March) to infiltrate further 1 lakh and with a third invasion taking only 4 days (∼23rd March), indicating SARS-CoV-2 to be a highly transmissive type virus. COVID-19 not only killed people through virus incursion but also due to economic and mental collapse, where developing countries suffered from unemployment and hunger. India enforced 68 days of four-phased-lockdown starting from 24th March ∼31st May to deal with COVID-19.

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on India's Covid-19 Situation.
